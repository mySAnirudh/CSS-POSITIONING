    CSS helps you to position your HTML element. You can put any HTML element at 
whatever location you like. You can specify whether you want the element 
positioned relative to its natural position in the page or absolute based on its 
parent element.
Now, we will see all the CSS positioning related properties with examples.
Relative Positioning
Relative positioning changes the position of the HTML element relative to where 
it normally appears. So "left:20" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position.
You can use two values top and left along with the position property to move an 
HTML element anywhere in an HTML document. 
 Move Left - Use a negative value for left.
 Move Right - Use a positive value for left.
 Move Up - Use a negative value for top.
 Move Down - Use a positive value for top.
